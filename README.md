# NoitaQuickSave
### A small script based on AutoHotkey that allows to save and load in the Noita game using **F5** and **F9** buttons.

## Usage

- Download and unpack or clone this repo. 

- Launch either the NoitaQuickSave.exe or NoitaQuickSave.ahk if you have autohotkey installed on your machine.

- To quick save your progress just hit **F5** when in game (the game cannot be paused and inventory cannot be opened).

- To load the last quick save hit **F9** at any time.

- You can find and close the tool in the system tray.

- Enjoy.
